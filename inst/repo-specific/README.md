# Bioconductor git-hooks

This repository hosts the git hooks which are deployed on each Bioconductor package.

## Naming convention

The name of the repository is `repo-specific` because of the way Bioconductor manages the it's git-server using **gitolite**. The hooks are meant to be placed in a directory called `local`, because of a design decision made in 2016 we called the directory which stores the git hooks `local/hooks/repo-specific`. Hence, the name `repo-specific`.

This repository acts as a submodule within the Bioconductor git server which manages the hooks.
